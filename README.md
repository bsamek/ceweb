This is a snapshot from 5/9/2011 of the website and CMS I wrote for the
Simmons GSLIS Continuing Education deparment. It's a PHP/MySQL application
which keeps track of instructors and classes. Users can view classes sorted in
useful ways, and the administrator can add classes with an easy web interface.
