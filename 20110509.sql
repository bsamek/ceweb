You\'ll learn effective and necessary search techniques for answering a range of different questions such as how to develop a financial picture when financials are not readily available, the importance of researching key executives and board members with methods for finding hard-to-find information about them, how to find and access suppliers, what\'s required for due diligence before doing business with a company or when considering a merger or acquisition - and more.

Over the month national graphic novel expert Robin Brenner will start by covering all of the basics of the format: what defines graphic novels, the history of comics and graphic novels, and who they\'re written for.  Then the class will progress through how to select them for your collection whether it be for adults or for academic study.

Students will have a chance to read about and discuss programming, censorship and challenges, and cataloging related to graphic novels.  Every student should finish the month with an understanding of the format and how to start and/or maintain their collection.

While challenging, itâ€™s never dull. Owning a research business is one way to generate income creatively, puts you in charge of your life, makes it possible to work from home, and is intellectually stimulating.
